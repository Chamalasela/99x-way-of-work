    "metaDescription": "A visualization of an individual’s experience with a product or service over time and across different perspectives. Mapping these experiences is a vital part of being a human-centered business, and it’s essential to look at both aspects — what the person experiences, and what went on outside of their view to make it happen. Customer journey mapping and service blueprinting are two complementary methods that can help you see both sides of your services. Yet these two methods; the journey map and the service blueprint, and how they differ from each other are often confused.",
