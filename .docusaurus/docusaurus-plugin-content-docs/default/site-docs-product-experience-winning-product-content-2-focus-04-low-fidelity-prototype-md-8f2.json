    "metaDescription": "A prototype is a simulation of how the primary functionality of the product will work. It allows you to initiate discussions with other stakeholders such as domain experts, potential users, decision makers, etc. Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping is a quick and easy way to convert high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts. It doesnâ€™t have to be concrete or even look like a finished product.",
